Extracting Generators
=====================
So now that we have some data pools in which we know there exist points connected by symmetry, how can we actually
extract the generators which define the Lie algebra and therefore, the symmetry groups. The approach developed by
Sven Krippendorf and Marc Syvaeri on
`Detecting symmetries with neural networks <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abbd2d>`_ involves
framing the problem as regression.
